My sample.json file is loaded and parsed on both the game description page and on the game grid page.

The game description page displays the game_info json object right below the login field and above the game description.

The game grid displays the player_config json object. It displays the player's name and also loads in their pre-configured ship placement and adds them to the grid.

sample.json is located in the root of the project.
